# Machine-Learning
A collection of machine learning projects.
In some cases the algorithms are adapted from textbooks, in others libraries have been used.

I created these projects because they are in areas that interest me. 
These are all personal and experimental projects which likely contain bugs. They should not intended to be depended on by anyone for anything.
